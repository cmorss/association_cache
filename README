AssociationCache
================

Caches "some" active record associations.

For a belongs_to the object is looked up directly using the cache_key. If not found
then a find() is done and the object is put in the cache and returned.

Collections are turned into queries just for the ids and then if the objects are in the 
cache they are returned and if not they are fetched and added to the cache.

Example
=======

belongs_to :cow, :cached => true

has_many :chickens, :cached => true

has_and_belongs_to_many :farmers, :cached => true
